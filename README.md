# spectral signal analysis periodograms
 In signal processing, a periodogram is an estimate of the spectral density of a signal. 
Three methods have been implemeted and compared here: 
	- periodogram, 
	- averaged periodogram and 
	- Blackman Tukey method of power spectrum estimation.

This project was completed as homework #1 for subject Spectral Sygnal Analysis in 5th semester.
